Connectors Gallery is a collection of connectors created for Microsoft Power Platform.

The aim of this site is to list connectors for the Power Platform created by Power Platform community (only controls that can be downloaded are listed).

If you have an idea for a new connector, go to our <a target="_blank" href="https://powerplatform.sleekplan.app/">forum</a>, write your suggestion and maybe a developer/consultant will help you out.

If you created an APP and you would like to be listed inside this site, check the <a target="_blank" href="/submit">Submit a new PCF Control</a> page.

Please contact <a target="_blank" href="https://www.twitter.com/crmkeeper">@CRMKeeper</a> with a direct message if:

- you are the author and you want to add additional links beside your name (Twitter, LinkedIn, Website, ...)
- you are the author of an APP and want to remove it from this site

A BIG THANK YOU to Guido Preite for allowing us to run this site:)
