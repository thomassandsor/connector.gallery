Installing Connectors is not hard, you just need to know where to start:)

Find the connector you wish to try, and click the download button. This will open the GitHub repository where you will be able to find the files needed to import the connector. 

In this example there are 2 files. The configuration and the LOGO. Let's start by opening the What3Words.swagger.json file.

# Downloading

Image GitHubFiles

Then click on

GitHubFileRaw

Lastrly open right click on the file to download the .json file. 

GitHubRightClick

Repeat the process for the image file. 

# Importing

Now make your way to <a target="_blank" href="https://make.powerapps.com/">Power Apps Maker Portal</a>

Open
PPCustomConnector1
PPCustomConnector2
PPCustomConnector3
PPCustomConnector4
PPCustomConnector5

# Usage
You can now use the connector in Power Automate. Open up a new Power Automate, and select your custom connector. 

PS if you see a ðŸ’Ž in the connector.gallery the API will require a key / username for usage. In the case of What3Words a site like this can be found here.
